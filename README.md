**AI drafted. Council refined.**

A multi-agent council reviews your AI-generated code, debates blockers
across up to 3 rounds until it reaches consensus, and learns from every
merge + rejection so future reviews match your repo's real tolerance for
"blocker" vs "nit". Built for solo makers who ship with AI.

> **Status**: v0.1 on npm. Architecture locked (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`);
> dogfood-tested on this repo's own PRs.

## Who this is for

Anyone shipping AI-generated code or AI-built apps but not hiring a
reviewer. Concretely:

- **AI coding assistants** — Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Copilot
- **App-from-prompt builders** — v0, Lovable, Bolt, Base44
- **Autonomous agents** — Manus AI, Devin, Cognition-style task runners

This is **not** a tool for seasoned engineers polishing code they wrote
themselves. It is a council for code that came out of an AI.

## Start here (after install)

```bash
conclave init       # one-time setup
conclave audit      # run right away — full-project health check
```

`conclave audit` (v0.6.0) walks your repo, samples high-signal files,
and opens a GitHub issue with a prioritized list of real blockers /
majors / minors — no PR required. Budget-capped at $2 by default
(hard ceiling $10). See [docs/guides/audit.md](docs/guides/audit.md).

## How it works

```
You push AI-generated code
  ↓
Efficiency gate (cache / triage / budget / compact / route)
  ↓
Council — up to 3 rounds of debate across N agents
  Round 1: independent review
  Round 2: each agent sees the others' blockers, can revise
  Round 3: final vote; early-exit the moment all approve OR any reject
  ↓
Merged  → success pattern → answer-keys 
Rejected → failure pattern → failure-catalog
  ↓
Next review reads BOTH catalogs as RAG context → the council gets smarter
```

Both signals are first-class. Most ML systems use one (positive OR
negative); here `answer-keys ∥ failure-catalog` is the primitive — decision #17.

## The numbers

- **18 workspace packages** — core + 3 agents (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini) +
  4 notifiers (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Email) + 5 platform adapters
  (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages/Railway/GitHub deployment_status) +
  SCM + observability + visual review + CLI.
- **10 CLI commands** covering init → review → outcome capture →
  seeding → migration → scoring → federated sync → MCP server.
- **Cost per PR**: ~$0.05-$0.20 at current pricing with caching + triage,
  capped by a per-PR budget that the efficiency gate enforces before any
  LLM call fires.
- **Privacy-first federation**: `conclave sync` exchanges k-anonymous
  baseline signal (category + severity + tag vector + hash) with other
  users — no code, diffs, titles, or repo names ever leave your machine.
  OFF by default.

## CLI commands

```
conclave init                              # scaffold config + .conclave/ in repo
conclave audit [options]                   # v0.6+ — full-project health check
conclave review [--pr N] [--visual]        # run the 3-round council review
conclave record-outcome --id <ep-id> --result merged|rejected|reworked
conclave poll-outcomes [--quiet]           # auto outcome capture via gh
conclave seed [--from <path>]              # bootstrap failure-catalog
conclave migrate [--from <solo-cto-agent>] # port a v1 install
conclave scores [--json]                   # per-agent weighted performance
conclave sync [--dry-run|--push-only|--pull-only]  # federated baseline (opt-in)
conclave mcp-server                        # MCP stdio — Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf
```

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm add -g @conclave-ai/cli

# At least one agent key (any combination works; missing ones skip cleanly):
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

cd /path/to/your-repo
conclave init
conclave review --pr 42
```

Full walkthrough: [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Configuration

`.conclaverc.json` at your repo root. Minimal:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "agents": ["claude", "openai", "gemini"],
  "budget": { "perPrUsd": 0.5 },
  "council": { "maxRounds": 3, "enableDebate": true }
}
```

Full reference: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Privacy & federated sync

`conclave sync` is **opt-in**. Full privacy model + the exact wire format:
[docs/federated-sync.md](docs/federated-sync.md).

TL;DR: only `{kind, domain, category, severity, normalized tags, day
bucket, sha256(those fields)}` leaves — never the lesson text, title,
body, snippet, repo name, user name, diff, or commit message.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build               # compile all packages
pnpm dev                 # watch-mode
pnpm test                # node --test across every package
```

Requires Node ≥ 20 and pnpm ≥ 9. Monorepo is [Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo).

## Roadmap

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's shipped. Current state per
locked decision: [docs/decision-status.md](docs/decision-status.md).

Locked design decisions (do not reopen without explicit reason) live in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Relation to solo-cto-agent

`solo-cto-agent` is the v1 predecessor, still on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solo-cto-agent) in maintenance mode
(security fixes only). Conclave AI is a clean-slate rewrite under a new
`@conclave-ai` scope with a multi-agent architecture. `conclave migrate`
ports an existing solo-cto-agent install — config + failure-catalog +
per-step checklist.
