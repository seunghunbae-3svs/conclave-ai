# Decision status — where each locked decision lives in code

34 decisions were locked on 2026-04-19 (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`). This
document maps each one to its current implementation state. The goal is
to keep "what we decided" honest against "what we built" — without
re-litigating the decisions themselves.

Legend:
- ✅ **Implemented** — landed and test-covered.
- 🟡 **Partial / skeleton** — structure exists, behavior incomplete.
- 🔄 **Diverged** — implementation chose a different path from the
  doc. Rationale recorded below.
- ⏳ **Deferred** — intentionally not built yet; trigger for revisit
  documented.
- 📄 **Doc-only** — the decision is a principle or scope statement,
  not a code artifact.

## 🔄 #8 + #9 — Agent SDK migrations (diverged, not deferred)

**Decision text**:
- #8: Claude agent loop → `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` — "saves
  rolling our own tool_use loop; bundles MCP + compaction."
- #9: OpenAI agent loop → `@openai/agents` v0.8.x — "supersedes
  Assistants API; TS-native."

**What we built instead**: each agent (`agent-claude`, `agent-openai`,
`agent-gemini`) is a **one-shot reviewer**, not an agent loop. It
receives a `ReviewContext`, makes one structured-output call via the
provider's base SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `@google/genai`),
and returns a single `ReviewResult`. The multi-round debate lives in
`Council.deliberate()` (decision #7, one level up).

**Why this is a divergence, not a deferral**: the rationale for #8/#9
was "saves rolling our own tool_use loop." The current implementation
has no loop to save — agents call `submit_review` (Claude) or respond
with strict JSON (OpenAI / Gemini) **once** per invocation. The
agent-SDK wrappers are designed for autonomous multi-step agents
(Claude Code-style), which is both out of scope for a reviewer and
adds real weight:

- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` — 3.9 MB, bundles MCP + subagent
  system, designed for long-running autonomous loops.
- `@openai/agents` — pulls `@openai/agents-core`, `@openai/agents-openai`,
  `@openai/agents-realtime` as transitive deps.

**What would trigger migration**: if a future requirement puts
per-agent tool use inside a single review — e.g., an agent that calls
an MCP server mid-review to look up external context, or that iterates
after seeing its own failed proposals — the SDK abstractions start
earning their weight. At that point, #8/#9 become the right answer.

**Concretely**:
- If `agent-claude` starts needing tool orchestration beyond
  `submit_review`, migrate.
- If OpenAI adds a feature (computer-use, structured tool workflows)
  that we need and the base SDK doesn't expose cleanly, migrate.
- Until then, the base SDKs are the smaller, honest, testable choice.

The lock on #8/#9 is respected: we did not revisit the tradeoff
casually. We implemented the use case they anticipated (one-shot
structured review, with multi-round debate handled at the Council
layer) and found the SDKs don't fit that shape.

## ⏳ Intentionally deferred

| # | Topic | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | v2.1 agent set (Grok / Deepseek / Qwen / Bedrock / Vertex / Cheetah / Ollama) | v2.0 published + at least one user request for an agent outside the v2.0 set |

## Anything not in this table

…is either a principle/scope statement from `ARCHITECTURE.md` (counted
as 📄) or landed before this document existed and is visible in the
code. If you find something you think is missing, grep for the
decision number in commit messages — every merged PR references the
decisions it implements.
